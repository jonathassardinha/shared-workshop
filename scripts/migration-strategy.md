# Phase 4 Step 5: Mock Data Migration Strategy

## Analysis Results

### Current Database State

- **1 Real User**: Jonathas (cmdnj798700003vr6f5sap69t) with GitHub OAuth account
- **3 Mock Users**:
  - Alice Johnson (user-1) - owns 4 workshops
  - Bob Smith (user-2) - owns 4 workshops
  - Carol Davis (user-3) - owns 4 workshops

### Total Impact

- **12 workshops** owned by mock users
- **3 workshops** owned by real users

## Chosen Strategy: Option C - Preserve as-is and handle orphaned workshops

### Rationale

1. **Development Environment**: This is a development setup where preserving test data is valuable
2. **Real User Impact**: Minimal - only 1 real user who can continue normally
3. **Test Data Value**: Mock workshops provide good test scenarios
4. **Low Risk**: No data loss, easily reversible

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Mark Mock Users

- Add a field or flag to identify mock users
- Ensure mock users cannot be used for authentication
- Display clear indicators when viewing mock user content

#### 2. Workshop Access Handling

- Allow viewing mock workshops (read-only)
- Prevent editing/deletion of orphaned workshops by real users
- Show clear ownership indicators in UI

#### 3. Future Migration Path

- Keep option open to reassign workshops later
- Document process for production deployment
- Provide tools to clean up mock data when needed

### Implementation Steps

1. âœ… Analyze current data (completed)
2. âœ… Choose migration strategy (completed)
3. ðŸ”„ Implement orphaned workshop handling
4. ðŸ”„ Update UI to show workshop ownership status
5. ðŸ”„ Test data integrity after migration
6. ðŸ”„ Verify workshop access still works

## Migration Script

No data migration script needed - preserving current state.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Real users can access their workshops normally
- [ ] Mock workshops are clearly marked as legacy/demo content
- [ ] No authentication errors for mock users
- [ ] Workshop listing shows appropriate ownership indicators
- [ ] New workshops created by real users work correctly

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. No rollback needed - no data was modified
2. Original mock authentication can be re-enabled if necessary
3. Mock user workshops remain accessible
