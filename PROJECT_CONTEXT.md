## Overview

A coding exercise platform for frontend workshops with an in-browser multi-file editor, supporting workshop creation, management, and live coding sessions.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js v22 (managed via nvm)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm@10.12.2 (managed via corepack)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4.1.11
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (with Radix UI primitives)
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 beta
- **Database**: Prisma ORM (configured, not yet integrated)
- **State Management**: Jotai + React Context
- **Module System**: ESM (`"type": "module"` in package.json)

### Key Libraries

- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor + Sandpack (for live preview)
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form + @hookform/resolvers (with zod validation)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Utilities**: clsx, tailwind-merge, zod
- **Logging**: Custom Logger utility (ClientLogger/ServerLogger)

### Server Actions Architecture

- **Server Actions Preferred**: Use Next.js Server Actions instead of API route handlers whenever possible
- **Action Organization**: Store all server actions in `src/server/actions/` with domain-specific folders:
  - `src/server/actions/workshop/` - Workshop-related actions (create, update, delete, etc.)
  - `src/server/actions/user/` - User-related actions (profile, preferences, etc.)
  - `src/server/actions/auth/` - Authentication-related actions
- **Action Structure**: Each domain folder should contain:
  - Separate files for different action types (create.ts, read.ts, update.ts, delete.ts)
  - `<domain>.types.ts` file for parameter types that client components can safely import
  - **No barrel exports (index.ts)** to prevent accidental server/client code mixing
- **Type Safety**: Client components import types from `<domain>.types.ts`, server actions from specific action files
- **Benefits**: Better performance, type safety, and simplified data mutations with built-in validation

### Type System Guidelines

- **Naming Convention**: Use Prisma's naming pattern - `TableCreateInput`, `TableUpdateInput`, not `CreateTableInput`
- **No Simple Re-exports**: Don't re-export Prisma types without modifications (e.g., `export type WorkshopCreateInput = Prisma.WorkshopCreateInput` is prohibited)
- **Update Types**: Don't add `id` fields to update input types - If we need to target specific items, add another `id` param to the function not the update object.
- **Relational Queries**: Use `Prisma.<Table>GetPayload<{ include: { ... } }>` for complex queries with relations
- **Custom Types Only**: Only define custom types when Prisma's auto-generated types cannot properly represent the data
- **Utility Types**: Prefer `Pick`, `Partial`, and other utility types for creating subsets and variations
- **Return type**: Always use `ActionResult<T>` type, if we only need the `success` property you can do `ActionResult<void>`

### Editor System

- **EditorProvider**: Context managing file state, permissions, and actions
- **EditorModes**: `create` (workshop creation) | `edit` (live sessions)
- **Permissions**: Role-based (canCreateFiles, canDeleteFiles, canSubmit, canSave)
- **File Management**: Create, edit, delete files with validation and templates

## Business Requirements

### Application Purpose

Enable frontend workshop instructors to:

1. Create coding exercises with pre-configured files
2. Host live coding sessions with participants
3. Manage workshop content and access

### User Model & Permissions

**Ownership-Based Access Control:**

- Any user can create workshops (becomes owner)
- Workshop owners have `Edit` access to their workshops only
- Any user can participate in `Live` workshops
- Any user can view `Planned` or `Completed` workshops

### Workshop Lifecycle

- **Planned**: Workshop created but not yet started
- **Live**: Currently active workshop session
- **Completed**: Workshop that has ended

### Core Features

#### Workshop Creation

- Multi-step wizard (4 steps: Basic Info, Exercises, Configure Files, Review)
- File management with templates (tsx, ts, jsx, js, css, html, json, md)
- Exercise management (min 1, max 10 exercises)
- Form validation and error handling

#### Workshop Management

- List all workshops with filtering (Live Only, Planned Only, Completed Only)
- Role-based action buttons (Join/View/Manage based on ownership and status)
- Owner identification and permissions

#### Live Workshop Interface

- Split interface: File editor + Live preview (Sandpack)
- Role-specific actions:
  - **Participants**: Submit solutions
  - **Owners**: Save changes, manage session

#### Authentication

- NextAuth integration with mock users for development
- User profile management
- Development user switcher
- Permission guards and access control

## Current Status

### Working Features

**With Database Integration:**

- ✅ Complete database schema (Workshop, Exercise, WorkshopFile models)
- ✅ Type-safe server actions for all CRUD operations
- ✅ Proper discriminated union ActionResult types
- ✅ Domain-prefixed types files (workshop.types.ts, user.types.ts, auth.types.ts)
- ✅ Proper Prisma type usage (GetPayload for relations, direct Prisma inputs for actions)
- ✅ Utility-type-based derivations (Partial, Pick) to prevent typos and maintain consistency
- ✅ Type system guidelines enforced (no simple re-exports, proper naming conventions)

**With Mock Data (Ready for Database):**

- Complete workshop creation flow
- Workshop listing with filtering
- User authentication and role switching (NextAuth with mock providers)
- File editing with Monaco Editor
- Live preview with Sandpack
- Permission-based UI rendering

### Development Setup

- All dependencies installed and configured
- Tailwind v4 properly configured with shadcn/ui
- ESLint and Prettier configured
- Development server running on localhost:3000

### Key Files & Components

- **Editor Core**: `src/components/Editor/`
- **Workshop Logic**: `src/components/workshop/`
- **Auth System**: `src/lib/auth/` and `src/components/auth/`
- **Constants**: `src/lib/constants.ts`
- **Styling**: `src/styles/globals.css` (Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui)

## Notes for Future Development

- Currently using mock data throughout - database integration is the immediate priority
- Logger utility replaces all console usage
- File templates available for common file types
- Comprehensive TypeScript coverage throughout
- All UI components use shadcn/ui for consistency and accessibility
